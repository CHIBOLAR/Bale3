# Bale Inventory - Fabric Management System

## Project Overview

**Bale Inventory** is a Next.js-based fabric inventory management system targeting Indian textile traders. The application provides multi-tenant inventory tracking, sales order management, job work processing, and barcode-based stock tracking.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth Magic Links (passwordless) + Google OAuth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for images/files
- **Deployment**: Hostinger + Supabase Cloud
- **Access Control**: Two-tier system - Public demo + Invite-only for official accounts
- **Email**: Resend (custom SMTP for magic links)
- **Future Enhancement**: Rust + Axum backend (post-MVP)

## ✅ Multi-Tenant Architecture Validation (Oct 13, 2025)

### Overview
Comprehensive review of multi-tenant architecture completed. Confirmed production-ready database structure with all required tenant isolation mechanisms in place. Architecture supports two-tier access (demo + full), multi-warehouse management, and role-based permissions per PRD requirements.

### Architecture Validation Results

**✅ Schema Structure Confirmed:**
```
auth.users (Supabase Auth)
    ↓ auth_user_id (FK)
public.users (Application users)
    ↓ company_id (FK)
companies (Tenant root)
    ↓ company_id (FK)
warehouses, products, partners, etc. (Tenant data)
```

**✅ Tenant Isolation:**
- ALL 25 tables have `company_id` for tenant isolation
- Warehouse-scoped tables also have `warehouse_id` (stock_units, goods_receipts, goods_dispatches, job_works)
- QR code/barcode tables (`barcode_batches`) have `company_id` - tenant-isolated by design

**✅ Multi-Warehouse Support:**
- **Admin users**: `warehouse_id = NULL` → Access ALL company warehouses
- **Staff users**: `warehouse_id` set → Limited to ONE assigned warehouse
- Confirmed in PRD permission matrix (admin sees all warehouses, staff sees assigned warehouse only)

**✅ Two-Tier Access System:**
```
Tier 1 (Demo): auth.users ONLY, no public.users record
    ↓ User requests upgrade
upgrade_requests table (pending approval)
    ↓ Admin approves
Tier 2 (Full): Creates company + public.users record + warehouse
```

### Key Architectural Decisions

**1. No Members Junction Table Needed**
- **Decision**: Keep current `public.users` table with direct `company_id` FK
- **Rationale**: One user = one company model fits textile trader business (not accountants/consultants)
- **Benefit**: Simpler architecture, faster MVP development
- **Future**: Can add members table later if multi-company per user is needed

**2. RLS & Auth Hook Deferred**
- **Decision**: Build features first with client-side filtering, add database-level security later
- **Current**: Manual `company_id` filtering in queries
- **Later** (Phase: Security Hardening):
  - Auth Hook (inject company_id, role, warehouse_id into JWT)
  - Triggers (auto-set company_id on INSERT)
  - RLS Policies (enforce at database level)
  - Performance indexes

**3. Validated Table Structure**
```sql
-- Core Tables
companies (id, name, is_demo, ...)
users (id, auth_user_id, company_id, role, warehouse_id, is_demo, is_superadmin, ...)
warehouses (id, company_id, name, ...)

-- Data Tables (all have company_id)
products, partners, sales_orders, job_works
stock_units, goods_receipts, goods_dispatches
barcode_batches, catalog_configurations, invites, product_variants

-- System Tables (auth-level)
upgrade_requests (no company_id until approval)
```

### Confirmed User Flows

**Demo User Journey:**
1. Sign up via Supabase Auth → `auth.users` created
2. NO `public.users` record created (key difference!)
3. User can still authenticate and access read-only dashboard
4. User requests upgrade → stored in `upgrade_requests`
5. Admin approves → atomically creates:
   - Company record (is_demo: false)
   - User record (auth_user_id linked, company_id set, role: admin)
   - Default warehouse

**Admin User Capabilities:**
- Manage multiple warehouses (warehouse_id = NULL)
- Full CRUD on all company data across all warehouses
- Create/assign staff to specific warehouses
- View all inventory, orders, dispatches across all warehouses

**Staff User Capabilities:**
- Limited to ONE assigned warehouse (warehouse_id set)
- View company products (read-only)
- Manage inventory in assigned warehouse only
- Create goods receipts/dispatches for assigned warehouse
- Cannot access other warehouses or manage settings

### Research & Validation Sources

**Validated Against:**
- ✅ Supabase official docs (2025 best practices)
- ✅ Context7 Supabase documentation
- ✅ Community best practices (AntStack, RoughlyWritten articles)
- ✅ PRD permission matrix requirements
- ✅ Existing production database schema

**Key Patterns Confirmed:**
1. Single Supabase project for all tenants (cost-effective, recommended)
2. `tenant_id` (company_id) on ALL data tables (strict isolation)
3. Auth Hooks for JWT claims injection (2025 approach)
4. Triggers for auto-populating tenant_id
5. Shared dimension tables for common lookups (optional)

### Implementation Priority

**NOW - Build Features (Phases 5-9):**
- Products Management
- Inventory/Goods Receipts
- Sales Orders
- Partners Management
- Job Works
- Manual `company_id` filtering in queries is sufficient for MVP

**LATER - Security Hardening:**
- Auth Hook implementation
- Trigger functions
- RLS policies
- Performance indexes

### Files to Reference
- **PRD**: `PRD.md` (complete permission matrix, user flows)
- **Upgrade Flow**: `docs/UPGRADE_FLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- **Current Sprint**: `.todo.md` (Phase 5-9 breakdown)

// Example: SO-2025-10-00001
async function generateOrderNumber(supabase: any, companyId: string): Promise<string> {
  const now = new Date();
  const year = now.getFullYear();
  const month = String(now.getMonth() + 1).padStart(2, '0');
  const prefix = `SO-${year}-${month}-`;

  // Find last order in current month
  const { data: lastOrder } = await supabase
    .from('sales_orders')
    .select('order_number')
    .eq('company_id', companyId)
    .like('order_number', `${prefix}%`)
    .order('order_number', { ascending: false })
    .limit(1)
    .single();

  let sequence = 1;
  if (lastOrder) {
    const lastNumber = lastOrder.order_number.split('-').pop();
    sequence = parseInt(lastNumber || '0', 10) + 1;
  }

  return `${prefix}${String(sequence).padStart(5, '0')}`;
}
```

**2. Dynamic Line Items:**
- Add/remove line items in form
- Product selection with auto-populated details
- Unit rate auto-fills from product selling price
- Quantity input with validation
- Line total auto-calculation
- Optional notes per line item

**3. Real-Time Calculations:**
```typescript
const calculateSubtotal = () => {
  return lineItems.reduce((sum, item) => {
    return sum + item.required_quantity * item.unit_rate;
  }, 0);
};

const calculateTotal = () => {
  const subtotal = calculateSubtotal();
  const discount = parseFloat(formData.discount_amount) || 0;
  return subtotal - discount;
};
```

**4. Explicit Foreign Key Hints:**
```typescript
// Learned from Goods Dispatch fixes
.select(`
  *,
  customer:partners!sales_orders_customer_id_fkey (
    id, company_name, first_name, last_name, partner_type
  ),
  agent:partners!sales_orders_agent_id_fkey (
    id, company_name, first_name, last_name
  ),
  fulfillment_warehouse:warehouses (id, name),
  items:sales_order_items (
    id,
    required_quantity,
    unit_rate,
    notes,
    products (id, name, product_number, material, color, measuring_unit)
  )
`)
```

**5. Order Statuses:**
- `pending` - Order placed, awaiting confirmation
- `confirmed` - Order confirmed, ready for fulfillment
- `in_progress` - Fulfillment in progress
- `completed` - Order fully fulfilled
- `cancelled` - Order cancelled

**6. Payment Tracking:**
- Subtotal calculation from line items
- Discount amount support
- Total amount after discount
- Advance payment tracking
- Balance due calculation and display

**7. Multi-Tenant Security:**
```typescript
// All queries filter by company_id
const { data: userData } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('company_id, is_demo')
  .eq('auth_user_id', user.id)
  .single();

const { data: orders } = await supabase
  .from('sales_orders')
  .select('...')
  .eq('company_id', userData.company_id)
  .is('deleted_at', null);
```

**8. Demo Mode Restrictions:**
- Demo users cannot create/edit orders
- Upgrade prompts on restricted actions
- Read-only detail views for demo users
- Full access for authenticated users

### Database Schema Used

**`sales_orders` table:**
- id, company_id, order_number, customer_id, agent_id
- order_date, expected_delivery_date
- fulfillment_warehouse_id
- total_amount, discount_amount, advance_amount
- status, notes
- created_at, updated_at, created_by, modified_by, deleted_at

**`sales_order_items` table:**
- id, sales_order_id, product_id
- required_quantity, unit_rate, line_total (generated)
- dispatched_quantity (generated), pending_quantity (generated)
- notes

**Generated Columns:**
- `line_total` - Auto-calculated as `required_quantity * unit_rate`
- `dispatched_quantity` - Sum from goods_dispatch_items
- `pending_quantity` - `required_quantity - dispatched_quantity`

### Technical Patterns Applied

**Server Component → Client Component Pattern:**
1. `page.tsx` - Fetches data on server (no client state)
2. `Client.tsx` - Handles interactivity (search, filters, navigation)
3. `Form.tsx` - Manages form state and validation
4. `actions.ts` - Server actions for mutations

**Form Data Flow:**
1. User fills form → FormData collected
2. Submit triggers server action
3. Server validates and creates order + items
4. Revalidates paths for cache updates
5. Redirects to success page
6. Returns success/error result

**Query Optimization:**
- Single query fetches order with all relationships
- Explicit FK hints prevent ambiguous relationship errors
- Selective field fetching (only needed columns)
- Company-scoped queries for tenant isolation

### Testing Status

## ✅ Goods Receipt & Dispatch List Pages Fixed (Oct 16, 2025)

### Overview
Fixed critical database query errors and architectural issues in both goods receipts and goods dispatch list pages that were causing 404 errors and "column does not exist" errors.

### Issues Resolved

**Goods Dispatch Page:**
1. **Missing Foreign Key Hints** - PostgREST couldn't resolve ambiguous relationships
2. **Wrong Column Names** - Querying `partners.name` instead of `partners.company_name`
3. **TypeScript Interface Mismatch** - Client component expecting different field names

**Goods Receipts Page:**
1. **Wrong Architecture Pattern** - Client component using useEffect to call server actions (caused routing issues)
2. **Non-existent Columns** - Querying `code` and `partner_code` columns that don't exist
3. **Missing Relations** - Not including `goods_receipt_items` and `source_warehouses` relations

### Changes Made

**Goods Dispatch (`app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/`):**
- Updated `page.tsx` with explicit FK hints:
  - `warehouses!goods_dispatches_warehouse_id_fkey`
  - `partners!goods_dispatches_dispatch_to_partner_id_fkey`
  - `warehouses!goods_dispatches_dispatch_to_warehouse_id_fkey`
- Fixed `partners` query: `name` → `company_name`
- Updated `GoodsDispatchClient.tsx` TypeScript interface

**Goods Receipts (`app/dashboard/inventory/goods-receipts/`):**
- Converted `page.tsx` from client component to **server component** (follows goods-dispatch pattern)
- Removed client-side useEffect data fetching
- Added proper server-side data fetching with server actions
- Updated `app/actions/inventory/goods-receipts.ts`:
  - Added explicit FK hints to all queries
  - Removed non-existent `code`, `partner_code` columns
  - Added `goods_receipt_items` relation for quantity totals
  - Added `source_warehouses` relation for transfer receipts
- Updated `GoodsReceiptsClient.tsx` TypeScript interfaces
- Simplified display functions (removed non-existent field concatenation)

### Server-Client Pattern Applied

Both pages now follow the same architecture:
```typescript
// page.tsx (Server Component)
- Handles authentication
- Fetches data on server using server actions
- Passes data as props to client component

// Client.tsx (Client Component)
- Receives data as props (not useEffect)
- Handles filtering and interactions
- Manages client-side state
```

### Database Query Fixes

**Before (Broken):**
```typescript
.select('*, warehouses (name), partners:issued_by_partner_id (company_name)')
```

**After (Working):**
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  warehouses!goods_receipts_warehouse_id_fkey (id, name),
  partners:partners!goods_receipts_issued_by_partner_id_fkey (id, company_name, partner_type),
  source_warehouses:warehouses!goods_receipts_issued_by_warehouse_id_fkey (id, name),
  goods_receipt_items (quantity_received)
`)
```

### Testing Status
- ✅ Dev server restarted to clear build cache
- ✅ Goods dispatch page loads without errors
- ✅ Goods receipts page loads without errors
- ✅ No "column does not exist" errors
- ✅ No "ambiguous relationship" errors
- ✅ All relationships resolve correctly
- ✅ Stock units, partners, warehouses display properly
- ✅ Quantity totals calculate correctly

### Files Modified
- `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/GoodsDispatchClient.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-receipts/page.tsx` (complete rewrite)
- `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-receipts/GoodsReceiptsClient.tsx`
- `app/actions/inventory/goods-receipts.ts`

### Goods Dispatch Functionality Fixes

**Issues Resolved:**
1. **Missing Warehouse Field** - Added "Dispatch from warehouse" dropdown to DispatchForm.tsx (line 230-253)
2. **Database Status Constraint Mismatch** - Fixed CHECK constraint to allow: pending, in_transit, delivered, cancelled
3. **Ambiguous Database Relationships** - Fixed PostgREST queries with explicit foreign key hints

**Database Migration:**
```sql
-- Fixed status check constraint
ALTER TABLE goods_dispatches DROP CONSTRAINT goods_dispatches_status_check;
ALTER TABLE goods_dispatches ADD CONSTRAINT goods_dispatches_status_check
  CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'in_transit', 'delivered', 'cancelled'));
```

  - Fixed partner field from `name` to `company_name`

**Verification Results:**
- ✅ 5 dispatches created successfully (GD-2025-10-00001 through GD-2025-10-00005)
- ✅ 10 stock units linked to dispatches via goods_dispatch_items
- ✅ All linked stock units have status updated to 'dispatched'
- ✅ Dispatch detail pages load without errors
- ✅ Multi-tenant filtering working correctly

### Technical Patterns Used

**Partners Module:**
- Server Components for data fetching
- Server Actions for mutations
- Client-side form validation
- Soft delete pattern (deleted_at)
- Audit trail (created_by, modified_by)
- Component reusability (PartnerForm for add/edit)
- Path revalidation after mutations

**Goods Dispatch Fixes:**
- Explicit foreign key relationship hints for PostgREST
- Database constraint alignment with TypeScript types
- Form validation matching database requirements
- Transaction-based dispatch creation (dispatch + items + status updates)

### Testing Status
- ✅ Partners list displays correctly
- ✅ Create partner with all fields works
- ✅ Edit partner pre-populates form
- ✅ Delete partner (soft delete) works
- ✅ Demo users cannot create/edit/delete partners
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation verified
- ✅ Goods dispatch creates successfully with warehouse selection

## ✅ Inventory Schema Fixes Completed (Oct 15, 2025)

### Overview
Fixed critical database schema mismatches that were preventing the inventory browser modal from loading stock units, products, and partners. All database column references now match the actual schema.

### Issues Resolved
1. **Product Material Column**: Changed all `fabric_type` references to `material` (actual column name)
2. **Partner Name Column**: Changed all `partners.name` references to `partners.company_name` (actual column name)
3. **TypeScript Type Definitions**: Updated all type interfaces to match database schema

### Errors Fixed
- ✅ `column products_1.fabric_type does not exist` → Now uses `material`
- ✅ `column partners.name does not exist` → Now uses `company_name`

### Files Modified (15 total)

**Product Material Column (`fabric_type` → `material`):**
1. `app/actions/inventory/data.ts` - getStockUnits, getStockUnit functions
2. `app/actions/inventory/goods-dispatch.ts` - Product queries
3. `app/actions/inventory/goods-receipts.ts` - Product queries
4. `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-receipts/[id]/page.tsx` - Product display

6. `app/dashboard/inventory/stock-units/[id]/page.tsx` - Product detail display
7. `app/dashboard/inventory/qr-codes/[id]/page.tsx` - QR label generation
8. `lib/types/inventory.ts` - TypeScript type definitions (3 interfaces)

**Partner Company Name (`partners.name` → `partners.company_name`):**
1. `app/actions/inventory/data.ts` - getPartners function
2. `app/actions/inventory/goods-receipts.ts` - Partner queries (2 locations)
3. `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-receipts/page.tsx` - Partner query + UI display
4. `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-receipts/[id]/page.tsx` - Partner display
5. `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/page.tsx` - Partner query
6. `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/[id]/page.tsx` - Partner display
7. `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/GoodsDispatchClient.tsx` - Partner display
8. `lib/types/inventory.ts` - TypeScript type definitions (2 interfaces)

### Technical Impact
- **Inventory Browser Modal**: Now successfully loads stock units with product and partner data
- **Goods Dispatch**: Can now create dispatches with proper partner selection
- **Goods Receipt**: Partner information displays correctly
- **Stock Units**: Product material information displays correctly
- **TypeScript**: No type mismatches, proper IntelliSense support

### Testing Status
- ✅ Server starts without database errors
- ✅ No more "column does not exist" errors in logs
- ✅ Fresh Next.js build cache (.next directory cleared)
- 🔄 **Ready for testing**: User should test goods dispatch inventory browser to verify stock units load

### Next Steps
1. **Add Partners**: User needs to add partner records before creating goods dispatches
2. **Test Inventory Browser**: Verify stock units, products, and materials load correctly
3. **Test Goods Receipt Flow**: Create goods receipt → verify stock units created
4. **Test Goods Dispatch Flow**: Select stock units → create dispatch → verify status changes

1. `app/dashboard/products/ProductsClient.tsx` (329 lines) - Client component with all interactive features
2. `app/dashboard/products/[id]/page.tsx` (348 lines) - Product detail view
3. `app/dashboard/products/[id]/edit/page.tsx` (79 lines) - Product edit wrapper

### Files Modified
1. `app/dashboard/products/page.tsx` - Integrated ProductsClient component
2. `app/dashboard/products/ProductForm.tsx` - Fixed measuring unit values and enhanced UX

### Technical Patterns Used
- **Server Components**: Data fetching at page level with company_id filtering
- **Client Components**: Interactive features (search, filters, state management)
- **useMemo Optimization**: Efficient filtering and dynamic filter options
- **useState**: Client-side state for search term, filters, and view mode
- **Multi-tenant Security**: All queries filter by company_id
- **Demo Mode Handling**: Read-only enforcement, disabled actions, upgrade CTAs
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind CSS
- **Component Reusability**: ProductForm used for both create and edit

### Testing Status
- ✅ Products list displays correctly
- ✅ Search functionality works across name, product number, and tags
- ✅ Material and color filters populate dynamically
- ✅ Active filters display and can be removed individually
- ✅ Clear all filters resets to full list
- ✅ Results count updates correctly
- ✅ Grid/List view toggle persists state
- ✅ Product detail page shows all information
- ✅ Stock units count displays (0 until stock module built)
- ✅ Edit button navigates to edit page
- ✅ ProductForm pre-populates with existing data
- ✅ Demo users cannot edit products
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation works correctly

### Next Steps
**Phase 6: Stock Units Management** (Next Priority)
- Stock units list page with warehouse filtering
- Add stock unit (link to goods receipt)
- Stock unit detail page with history
- Status tracking (in_stock, reserved, dispatched, sold)
- Barcode/QR code generation for stock units
- Stock unit search and filters

### Documentation
- Updated `.todo.md` with Phase 5 completion
- Updated `.claude.md` with implementation details
- All code includes inline comments and proper TypeScript types

## ✅ Upgrade Flow Implementation Completed (Oct 12, 2025)

### Overview
Implemented a complete upgrade request system where demo users can request full platform access without creating database records until admin approval. This maintains the design principle of "no user record until approval" while providing a clean request management system.

### What Was Done
- ✅ **Created `upgrade_requests` table**: Separate table for storing upgrade requests (not in users table)
- ✅ **Updated request-invite API**: Stores requests in new table, no user record created until approval
- ✅ **Updated approve-upgrade API**: Creates company + user record + warehouse on approval
- ✅ **Fixed RLS policies**: Added policy to allow users to query their own auth_user_id without DB record
- ✅ **Created login page**: OTP-based login page that was previously deleted
- ✅ **Fixed admin panel**: Updated to fetch from upgrade_requests table, fixed column name issues
- ✅ **Fixed superadmin access**: Updated bale.inventory@gmail.com permissions
- ✅ **Comprehensive documentation**: Created `docs/UPGRADE_FLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- ✅ **Git management**: Merged to main branch with proper commit messages

### Database Changes

**New Table: `upgrade_requests`**
```sql
- id, auth_user_id, email, name, phone, company, message
- status (pending/approved/rejected)
- created_at, updated_at, approved_at, approved_by
- rejected_at, rejected_by, rejection_reason
```

**New Migration: `allow_users_to_query_own_auth_id`**
- RLS policy allowing authenticated users to query for their own auth_user_id
- Enables demo users without DB records to check if they exist

### User Flow

**Demo User Journey:**
1. User authenticates (exists in auth.users only, no public.users record)
2. User browses dashboard in demo mode
3. User clicks "Request Upgrade" → fills form (name, phone, company, message)
4. Request stored in `upgrade_requests` table (status: pending)
5. User continues using demo while waiting

**Admin Approval Journey:**
1. Admin logs into admin panel at `/dashboard/admin/invite-requests`
2. Admin sees pending requests with user details
3. Admin clicks "Approve & Upgrade Instantly"
4. System creates: new company → user record → default warehouse
5. Request marked as approved
6. User can now log in with full access

### Files Changed
- `app/api/request-invite/route.ts` - Rewritten to use upgrade_requests table
- `app/api/admin/approve-upgrade/route.ts` - Rewritten to create user on approval
- `app/dashboard/request-upgrade/page.tsx` - Fixed to handle users without DB records
- `app/dashboard/admin/invite-requests/page.tsx` - Updated to fetch from upgrade_requests
- `app/dashboard/admin/invite-requests/InviteRequestsClient.tsx` - Updated interface
- `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` - Created (was previously deleted)
- Database migrations applied to production

### Git Status
- **Branch**: `feat/upgrade-flow-with-requests-table` (merged to main)
- **Commit**: 32f95a9 - "feat: Implement upgrade flow with dedicated requests table"
- **Merge Commit**: 5f8776e - "Merge feat/upgrade-flow-with-requests-table"
- **Status**: ✅ Pushed to main and deployed

### Testing Checklist
- ✅ Demo user can authenticate without user record
- ✅ Demo user can access dashboard
- ✅ Demo user can view request-upgrade page
- ✅ Demo user can submit upgrade request
- ✅ Admin can access admin panel with correct permissions
- ✅ Admin can see pending requests
- ✅ Admin approval creates company + user record (tested Oct 12, 2025)
- ✅ Approved user has full admin access (tested Oct 12, 2025)

### Test Results (Oct 12, 2025)
- **Approved Request**: Chirag Bolar (productmanagerchiragbolar@gmail.com) for "Chi fabrics"
- **Approved At**: 2025-10-12 17:05:48 UTC
- **Approved By**: bale.inventory@gmail.com (superadmin)
- **Company Created**: Chi fabrics (ID: a86a3118-0a77-4527-bb09-969e849b64e3)
- **User Created**: Chirag Bolar with role=admin, is_demo=false, is_active=true
- **Status**: ✅ Complete upgrade flow tested successfully

### Next Steps

## Migration Cleanup Completed (Jan 12, 2025) ✅

### What Was Done
- ✅ **Removed duplicate migration**: `20251010104313_add_invite_system.sql`
- ✅ **Created clean migration**: `20250112_clean_invites_table.sql`
- ✅ **Reduced invites table**: 19 columns → 13 columns (31% reduction)
- ✅ **Preserved all data**: Moved bloat columns to `metadata` JSONB
- ✅ **Updated code**: All references now use metadata instead of removed columns
- ✅ **Documented**: Created `MIGRATION_CLEANUP_ANALYSIS.md` and `TESTING_GUIDE_MIGRATION_CLEANUP.md`

### Columns Removed from Invites Table (6)
1. `accepted_at` - Not used in OTP flow
2. `used_by_email` - Duplicate of email
3. `used_by_user_id` - Moved to metadata.used_by
4. `used_at` - Moved to metadata.used_at
5. `created_by` - Usually same as invited_by
6. `generation_method` - Moved to metadata.generation_method

### Current Clean Schema
**Invites Table (13 columns):**
- Core: `id`, `invite_type`, `code`, `email`, `status`
- References: `company_id`, `warehouse_id`, `role`, `invited_by`
- Timestamps: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `expires_at`
- Flexible: `metadata` (JSONB for request_type, used_at, used_by, etc.)

### Testing Status
⚠️ **Pending**: Migration needs testing before production deployment

**Test Options:**
1. **Option A (Recommended)**: Test on Supabase preview branch
2. **Option B (Riskier)**: Direct production push with backup

See `TESTING_GUIDE_MIGRATION_CLEANUP.md` for complete testing instructions.

### Files Modified
- `supabase/migrations/20250112_clean_invites_table.sql` (new)
- `supabase/migrations/20251010104313_add_invite_system.sql` (deleted)
- `app/api/request-invite/route.ts` (generation_method → metadata)
- `app/auth/callback/route.ts` (removed accepted_at)
- `app/api/upgrade-account/route.ts` (removed accepted_at)

### Git Branch
- **Branch**: `feat/clean-core-migrations`
- **Commit**: 1195853 - "feat: Clean up invites table and remove duplicate migration"

### Supabase Branching (Testing Strategy)
**What it is**: Git-like branches for your entire database
- Each branch = separate Supabase instance (DB, Auth, Storage, API)
- Test migrations safely before production
- Auto-merge workflow

**Commands**:
```bash
# Create preview branch
npx supabase branches create clean-invites-test

# Test on branch
npx supabase db push

# Merge to production
npx supabase branches merge clean-invites-test
```

**Note**: Beta feature, requires opt-in, charged separately

### Next Steps
1. Test migration on Supabase preview branch (see TESTING_GUIDE)
2. If tests pass, merge to production
3. Merge `feat/clean-core-migrations` to `main`
4. Continue with Phase 5: Products Management

## Commands

### ⚠️ Important Development Note
**Schema Queries**: Do not query for schema using Supabase MCP tools - it consumes excessive tokens. Instead, ask the user to provide the schema file from migrations or refer to the migration files in `supabase/migrations/`.

### 🎯 Supabase AI Prompt Files - Usage Instructions

This project includes specialized Supabase AI prompt files in the root directory. **Always reference the appropriate prompt file(s) when working on related tasks** to ensure best practices and consistency.

#### When Creating Database Migrations
**Reference**: `@Create migration.md`

Use this file when:
- Creating new tables, columns, indexes, or constraints
- Modifying database schema structure
- Setting up Row Level Security on new tables
- Creating database triggers

**Key Requirements**:
- Migration file naming: `YYYYMMDDHHmmss_description.sql` (UTC timestamp)
- All SQL in lowercase with copious comments
- Enable RLS on ALL new tables (even public tables)
- Create separate RLS policies per operation (select, insert, update, delete)
- One policy for each Supabase role (anon, authenticated)

**Example Task**: "Create a migration to add a new `orders` table"
→ Include `@Create migration.md` in your task context

---

#### When Creating Database Functions or Triggers
**Reference**: `@Create functions.md`

Use this file when:
- Creating stored procedures or database functions
- Setting up triggers for automated workflows
- Implementing custom database logic
- Creating reusable database utilities

**Key Requirements**:
- Default to `SECURITY INVOKER` (not SECURITY DEFINER)
- Always set `search_path = ''` for security
- Use fully qualified names (e.g., `public.table_name`)
- Explicit typing for all parameters
- Include error handling where appropriate

**Example Task**: "Create a trigger function to auto-update timestamps"
→ Include `@Create functions.md` in your task context

---

#### When Creating or Modifying RLS Policies
**Reference**: `@RLS policies.md`

Use this file when:
- Adding Row Level Security policies to tables
- Modifying existing security policies
- Implementing multi-tenant data isolation
- Setting up role-based access control

**Key Requirements**:
- Use `auth.uid()` instead of `current_user`
- Separate policies for SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE (never use `FOR ALL`)
- SELECT policies: Use `USING`, not `WITH CHECK`
- INSERT policies: Use `WITH CHECK`, not `USING`
- UPDATE policies: Use both `USING` and `WITH CHECK`
- DELETE policies: Use `USING`, not `WITH CHECK`
- Specify roles with `TO authenticated` or `TO anon`
- Add indexes for columns used in policies
- Wrap functions with `select` for performance: `(select auth.uid())`

**Example Task**: "Create RLS policies for the products table"
→ Include `@RLS policies.md` in your task context

---

#### When Managing Database Schema Declaratively
**Reference**: `@Declarative Database Schema.md`

Use this file when:
- Using the declarative schema management approach
- Creating/modifying files in `supabase/schemas/` directory
- Generating migrations via `supabase db diff`
- Managing schema versions and rollbacks

**Key Requirements**:
- ALL schema changes go in `supabase/schemas/` directory
- Do NOT create files directly in `supabase/migrations/`
- Stop Supabase before generating diffs: `supabase stop`
- Generate migration: `supabase db diff -f <migration_name>`
- Files execute in lexicographic order (name them carefully)
- Known caveats: DML, view ownership, alter policies, comments, partitions

**Example Task**: "Add a new column to the users table using declarative schema"
→ Include `@Declarative Database Schema.md` in your task context

**Note**: This approach is mutually exclusive with manual migration creation. Check with the user which approach the project uses.

---

#### When Implementing Realtime Features
**Reference**: `@# Supabase Realtime AI Assistant Guide.md`

Use this file when:
- Implementing live data synchronization
- Setting up websocket-based communication
- Creating real-time notifications or messaging
- Building presence tracking features
- Migrating from `postgres_changes` to `broadcast`

**Key Requirements**:
- **Use `broadcast`** for all realtime events (preferred over `postgres_changes`)
- Use `presence` sparingly for user state tracking only
- Use dedicated topics per entity: `scope:entity:id` (e.g., `room:123:messages`)
- Event names in snake_case: `entity_action` (e.g., `message_created`)
- Set `private: true` for channels using database triggers or RLS
- Create indexes for columns used in RLS policies
- Include unsubscribe/cleanup logic in all implementations
- Use database triggers with `realtime.broadcast_changes()` for database events
- Implement proper error handling and reconnection logic

**Example Task**: "Add real-time updates to the chat feature"
→ Include `@# Supabase Realtime AI Assistant Guide.md` in your task context

---

#### Combining Multiple Prompt Files

For complex tasks, reference **multiple prompt files** as needed:

**Example**: "Create a new messages table with realtime broadcasting"
→ Include:
- `@Create migration.md` (for table creation)
- `@Create functions.md` (for broadcast trigger)
- `@RLS policies.md` (for access control)
- `@# Supabase Realtime AI Assistant Guide.md` (for realtime setup)

**Example**: "Set up RLS on the orders table and create helper functions"
→ Include:
- `@RLS policies.md` (for policies)
- `@Create functions.md` (for helper functions)

---

#### Quick Reference Table

| Task Type | Prompt File(s) to Include |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| Add new table | `@Create migration.md` + `@RLS policies.md` |
| Add column | `@Create migration.md` OR `@Declarative Database Schema.md` |
| Create trigger | `@Create functions.md` |
| Add RLS policy | `@RLS policies.md` |
| Schema refactor | `@Declarative Database Schema.md` |
| Realtime feature | `@# Supabase Realtime AI Assistant Guide.md` + `@Create functions.md` |
| Complete CRUD module | All 5 files (table + functions + RLS + realtime) |

## Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Design
The system uses **company-based multi-tenancy** with Row Level Security:
- **Tenant = Company**: Complete data isolation between companies
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin (full access) vs Staff (warehouse-scoped)
- **Warehouse Scoping**: Staff can only access their assigned warehouse

### Entity Hierarchy
```
Company (Tenant)
├── Users (Admin/Staff with warehouse assignment)
├── Warehouses (multiple per company)
├── Products (company-wide fabric specifications)
├── Stock Units (physical fabric rolls in warehouses)
├── Partners (Customers, Vendors, Suppliers, Agents)
├── Sales Orders (customer orders with fulfillment tracking)
├── Job Works (outsourced work: dyeing, printing, embroidery)
├── Goods Dispatches (outward stock movement)
└── Goods Receipts (inward stock movement)
```

### Access Control Matrix

| Feature | Admin | Staff |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Company Profile | Full CRUD | Read only |
| Warehouses | Full CRUD | No access |
| Users/Staff | Full CRUD | No access |
| Products | Full CRUD | Read only |
| Partners | Full CRUD | Read only |
| Stock Units | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Goods Receipts | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Goods Dispatches | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Sales Orders | Full access | Assigned warehouse only |
| Job Works | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Barcode Generation | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Public Catalog Config | Full CRUD | No access |

### Database Security
All tables have **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies:
- **Company Isolation**: Users can only see data from their company
- **Warehouse Scoping**: Staff users can only access data from their assigned warehouse
- **Role Checks**: Admin role bypasses warehouse restrictions

### Key Business Logic

**Inventory Flow**:
- Stock can only be **added** via Goods Receipt
- Stock can only be **removed** via Goods Dispatch
- Stock status: `in_stock`, `reserved`, `dispatched`, `sold`

**Fabric-Specific Features**:
- Color management (name + hex code)
- GSM (fabric weight) tracking
- Material types (cotton, polyester, silk, blend, etc.)
- Quality grades (A, B, C, D)
- Measuring units (meters, yards, pieces, kg)

**Audit Trail**:
- All entities have: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `modified_by`, `deleted_at`
- Soft deletes for historical tracking

5. **Make Changes**: Edit code, database auto-reloads
6. **Commit Changes**: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`

## Authentication System - Two-Tier Access

### Overview

Bale Inventory uses a **two-tier authentication system** with Supabase Magic Links:

**Tier 1: Public Demo Access (Frictionless Trial)**
- Anyone can get instant demo access via magic link
- Users are assigned to a shared demo company
- Read-only access to pre-loaded sample data
- No credit card or password required

**Tier 2: Official Company Account (Invite-Only)**
- Requires approved invitation from admin
- Creates dedicated company with full access
- Includes onboarding call and setup assistance
- Complete CRUD operations for all features

### Magic Link Flow

#### Demo Signup (No Invite)
1. User visits homepage → Enters email
2. Receives magic link email (Supabase Auth OTP)
3. Clicks link → Auth callback checks for invite
4. No invite found → Assigned to demo company
5. User record created with `is_demo: true`, `role: customer`
6. Redirected to dashboard with demo data
7. See banner: "You're viewing demo account" + "Request Official Access"

#### Official Signup (With Invite)
1. User explores demo → Clicks "Request Official Access"
2. Fills form (name, email, phone, company)
3. Request saved to `invite_requests` table with status `pending`
4. Admin reviews request in admin panel
5. Admin approves → System generates invite code
6. User receives email with invite code
7. User clicks invite link → Receives magic link
8. Clicks magic link → Auth callback finds valid invite
9. New company + warehouse created
10. User record created with `is_demo: false`, `role: admin`
11. Invite marked as `accepted`
12. Redirected to dashboard with own company

### Authentication Methods

**Magic Link (Primary - Recommended)**
- Passwordless authentication
- User enters email → Receives link
- Click link to sign in
- Uses Supabase `signInWithOtp({ email })`
- PKCE flow (same device/browser required)

**Google OAuth (Alternative)**
- Social login with Google account
- Auto-validates invite by email
- No password needed
- Works for both demo and official signup

**Email/Password (Legacy)**
- Traditional signup with password
- Requires invite code entry
- Still supported but not primary flow

### Demo Account Features

**What Demo Users Can Do:**
- ✅ View all products (50+ samples)
- ✅ View sales orders (5+ samples)
- ✅ View partners (10+ samples)
- ✅ View stock units
- ✅ Explore dashboard statistics
- ✅ Navigate all pages

**What Demo Users Cannot Do:**
- ❌ Create new products
- ❌ Create sales orders
- ❌ Modify existing data
- ❌ Delete records
- ❌ Access settings/admin panels
- ❌ Generate real barcodes

**Security:**
- Enforced via RLS policies at database level
- Demo users filtered by `is_demo = true`
- Can only SELECT from demo company data
- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE blocked

### Testing the Application

#### Test Demo Access
1. Go to homepage: http://localhost:3000
2. Enter email address
3. Click "Try Demo"
4. Check email inbox
5. Click magic link
6. Should redirect to dashboard
7. Verify demo banner appears
8. Verify cannot create products (button disabled)

#### Test Official Signup
1. From demo dashboard, click "Request Official Access"
2. Fill out form with details
3. Submit request
4. Admin reviews in `/dashboard/admin/invite-requests`
5. Admin clicks "Approve"
6. Check email for invite code
7. Click invite link or enter code
8. Receive magic link
9. Click magic link
10. Verify new company created
11. Verify full access (can create products)

#### Test Edge Cases
- Click magic link twice (should show error)
- Magic link expired (1 hour timeout)
- Invalid invite code
- Expired invite code (48 hours)
- Demo user requesting invite (should allow)
- Official user trying to access demo (should show own data)

### Verify Database
1. Open Supabase Studio: http://localhost:54323
2. Navigate to Table Editor
3. **Check demo setup:**
   - companies table → Find `is_demo = true`
   - users table → Check demo users with `is_demo = true`
   - products table → Verify 50+ demo products
4. **Check official signup:**
   - companies table → New company with `is_demo = false`
   - users table → New user with `is_demo = false`, `role = admin`
   - warehouses table → New "Main Warehouse" for company
5. **Check invite system:**
   - invite_requests table → Pending/approved/rejected requests
   - invites table → Generated invite codes with status

## Deployment

Refer to `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for complete Hostinger deployment instructions.

### Quick Deployment Steps
1. Create production Supabase project
2. Run migrations: `npx supabase db push`

## Troubleshooting

### Supabase Not Starting
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker ps

# Restart Docker and retry
npx supabase stop
npx supabase start
```

### Migration Errors
```bash
# Reset database completely
npx supabase db reset

# If circular dependency errors, check migration order
# Stock units migration should have nullable created_from_receipt_id
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Authentication Issues
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Supabase project is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify middleware.ts is configured correctly
