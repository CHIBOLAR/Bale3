# Bale Inventory - Fabric Management System

## Project Overview

**Bale Inventory** is a Next.js-based fabric inventory management system targeting Indian textile traders. The application provides multi-tenant inventory tracking, sales order management, job work processing, and barcode-based stock tracking.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (JWT-based)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for images/files
- **Deployment**: Hostinger + Supabase Cloud
- **Future Enhancement**: Rust + Axum backend (post-MVP)

## Commands

## Architecture

### Multi-Tenant Design
The system uses **company-based multi-tenancy** with Row Level Security:
- **Tenant = Company**: Complete data isolation between companies
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin (full access) vs Staff (warehouse-scoped)
- **Warehouse Scoping**: Staff can only access their assigned warehouse

### Entity Hierarchy
```
Company (Tenant)
â”œâ”€â”€ Users (Admin/Staff with warehouse assignment)
â”œâ”€â”€ Warehouses (multiple per company)
â”œâ”€â”€ Products (company-wide fabric specifications)
â”œâ”€â”€ Stock Units (physical fabric rolls in warehouses)
â”œâ”€â”€ Partners (Customers, Vendors, Suppliers, Agents)
â”œâ”€â”€ Sales Orders (customer orders with fulfillment tracking)
â”œâ”€â”€ Job Works (outsourced work: dyeing, printing, embroidery)
â”œâ”€â”€ Goods Dispatches (outward stock movement)
â””â”€â”€ Goods Receipts (inward stock movement)
```

### Access Control Matrix

| Feature | Admin | Staff |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Company Profile | Full CRUD | Read only |
| Warehouses | Full CRUD | No access |
| Users/Staff | Full CRUD | No access |
| Products | Full CRUD | Read only |
| Partners | Full CRUD | Read only |
| Stock Units | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Goods Receipts | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Goods Dispatches | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Sales Orders | Full access | Assigned warehouse only |
| Job Works | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Barcode Generation | All warehouses | Assigned warehouse only |
| Public Catalog Config | Full CRUD | No access |

### Database Security
All tables have **Row Level Security (RLS)** policies:
- **Company Isolation**: Users can only see data from their company
- **Warehouse Scoping**: Staff users can only access data from their assigned warehouse
- **Role Checks**: Admin role bypasses warehouse restrictions

### Key Business Logic

**Inventory Flow**:
- Stock can only be **added** via Goods Receipt
- Stock can only be **removed** via Goods Dispatch
- Stock status: `in_stock`, `reserved`, `dispatched`, `sold`

**Fabric-Specific Features**:
- Color management (name + hex code)
- GSM (fabric weight) tracking
- Material types (cotton, polyester, silk, blend, etc.)
- Quality grades (A, B, C, D)
- Measuring units (meters, yards, pieces, kg)

**Audit Trail**:
- All entities have: `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `modified_by`, `deleted_at`
- Soft deletes for historical tracking

## Environment Variables

### Local Development (.env.local)
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_local_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_local_service_role_key
```

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your_project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_production_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_production_service_role_key
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Start Supabase**: `npx supabase start` (Docker must be running)
2. **Run Next.js**: `npm run dev`
3. **Access Application**: http://localhost:3000
4. **Access Supabase Studio**: http://localhost:54323
5. **Make Changes**: Edit code, database auto-reloads
6. **Commit Changes**: `git add . && git commit -m "message" && git push`

## Testing the Application

### Create Test Account
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/signup
2. Fill in company details and admin user details
3. Submit - creates company, user, and default warehouse
4. Redirects to dashboard

### Test Authentication
1. Logout from dashboard
2. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
3. Login with created credentials
4. Should redirect to dashboard with stats

### Verify Database
1. Open Supabase Studio: http://localhost:54323
2. Navigate to Table Editor
3. Check tables: companies, users, warehouses
4. Verify your test data exists

## Deployment

Refer to `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for complete Hostinger deployment instructions.

### Quick Deployment Steps
1. Create production Supabase project
2. Run migrations: `npx supabase db push`
3. Update `.env.production` with production credentials
4. Build: `npm run build`
5. Upload to Hostinger via SSH or File Manager
6. Run with PM2: `pm2 start npm --name "bale-inventory" -- start`

## Troubleshooting

### Supabase Not Starting
```bash
# Check Docker status
docker ps

# Restart Docker and retry
npx supabase stop
npx supabase start
```

### Migration Errors
```bash
# Reset database completely
npx supabase db reset

# If circular dependency errors, check migration order
# Stock units migration should have nullable created_from_receipt_id
```

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
rm -rf .next node_modules
npm install
npm run build
```

### Authentication Issues
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Supabase project is running
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify middleware.ts is configured correctly
