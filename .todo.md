# Bale Inventory - Development Tasks

## ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Upgrade Flow Implementation (Oct 13, 2025)

### What Was Completed
Successfully implemented the upgrade request and approval system that allows demo users to request full platform access without polluting the users table until admin approval.

**Key Achievement**: Maintained design principle that demo users authenticate without creating database records until their upgrade is approved by admin.

### Changes Made
1. **Database Schema**
   - Created `upgrade_requests` table with RLS policies
   - Added policy to allow users to query their own auth_user_id from users table
   - Migration: `create_upgrade_requests_table`
   - Migration: `allow_users_to_query_own_auth_id`

2. **API Routes**
   - Complete rewrite: `app/api/request-invite/route.ts` (uses upgrade_requests table)
   - Complete rewrite: `app/api/admin/approve-upgrade/route.ts` (creates company/user/warehouse)
   - Fixed column name: is_super_admin ‚Üí is_superadmin

3. **Frontend Pages**
   - Fixed: `app/dashboard/request-upgrade/page.tsx` (handles users without DB records)
   - Updated: `app/dashboard/admin/invite-requests/page.tsx` (fetches from upgrade_requests)
   - Updated: `app/dashboard/admin/invite-requests/InviteRequestsClient.tsx` (new interface)
   - Created: `app/(auth)/login/page.tsx` (OTP-based login)

4. **Git Work**
   - Branch: feat/upgrade-flow-with-requests-table
   - Merged to main (no PR)
   - Pushed to remote
   - Comprehensive documentation: `docs/UPGRADE_FLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### Test Results (Oct 12, 2025) ‚úÖ
- **Approved Request**: Chirag Bolar (productmanagerchiragbolar@gmail.com) for "Chi fabrics"
- **Approved At**: 2025-10-12 17:05:48 UTC
- **Approved By**: bale.inventory@gmail.com (superadmin)
- **Company Created**: Chi fabrics (ID: a86a3118-0a77-4527-bb09-969e849b64e3)
- **User Created**: Chirag Bolar with role=admin, is_demo=false, is_active=true

### Testing Status
- [x] Demo user can authenticate and access dashboard
- [x] Request form loads and accepts submissions
- [x] Requests are saved to upgrade_requests table
- [x] Admin can view pending requests
- [x] Test approval flow end-to-end (completed Oct 12)
- [x] Verify user gets full access after approval (completed Oct 12)

### Outcome
‚úÖ **Upgrade flow fully tested and working** - Demo users can request access, admins can approve, and user records + companies are created successfully on approval.

### Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ ~~Test complete approval flow~~ (Completed Oct 12)
2. Build product/inventory modules to populate warehouse on approval (future)
3. Add email notifications on approval (future enhancement)
4. Consider rejection flow with admin notes (future enhancement)

## ‚úÖ CHECKPOINT: Multi-Tenant Architecture Validation (Oct 13, 2025)

### What Was Validated
Successfully validated that the existing database schema is production-ready for multi-tenant SaaS architecture with role-based access control.

**Key Achievement**: Confirmed schema supports tenant isolation, multi-warehouse operations, demo ‚Üí upgrade flow, and QR code generation without needing structural changes.

### Validation Results

1. **Schema Structure Confirmed** ‚úÖ
   ```
   auth.users (Supabase Auth)
       ‚Üì auth_user_id (FK)
   public.users (Application users)
       ‚Üì company_id (FK)
   companies (Tenant root)
       ‚Üì company_id (FK)
   All 25 data tables (Tenant-isolated data)
   ```

2. **Tenant Isolation Verified** ‚úÖ
   - ALL 25 tables have `company_id` for tenant isolation
   - Core tables checked: companies, users, warehouses, products, stock_units, goods_dispatches, goods_receipts, sales_orders, partners, job_works, barcode_batches
   - Warehouse-scoped tables have both `company_id` AND `warehouse_id`
   - QR code generation tables (barcode_batches) are tenant-isolated

3. **Multi-Warehouse Support Confirmed** ‚úÖ
   - Admin users: `warehouse_id = NULL` (access all warehouses)
   - Staff users: `warehouse_id` set (limited to assigned warehouse)
   - All warehouse-level operations properly scoped

4. **Two-Tier Access System** ‚úÖ
   - Demo users: Exist in `auth.users` only, no `public.users` record
   - Full users: Have record in both `auth.users` AND `public.users`
   - `upgrade_requests` table mediates transition from demo ‚Üí full
   - Upgrade approval atomically creates: company ‚Üí user ‚Üí warehouse

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **No Members Junction Table** ‚úÖ
   - Simple one-user-one-company model sufficient for textile trader use case
   - Direct `company_id` FK in users table
   - Can add members table later if multi-company per user becomes needed

2. **RLS & Auth Hook Implementation Deferred** ‚è∞
   - Build core features FIRST with manual `company_id` filtering
   - Implement RLS policies and Auth Hooks at the END (security hardening phase)
   - Auth Hooks already enabled in project, ready when needed

3. **Validated Table Structure** ‚úÖ
   - users.role: 'admin' | 'staff'
   - users.warehouse_id: NULL for admin, set for staff
   - users.is_demo: boolean (demo vs full user)
   - users.is_superadmin: boolean (platform admin flag)
   - All critical tables have proper tenant isolation

### Research Sources Consulted
- Supabase official documentation (Context7)
- 2025 best practices articles (AntStack, RoughlyWritten)
- Supabase Auth Hooks documentation
- Multi-tenancy patterns and RLS implementation guides
- PRD.md permission matrix validation

### Implementation Priority

**NOW (Phases 5-9): Build Core Features**
- Products Management
- Inventory Management
- Sales Orders
- Partners Management
- Settings & Administration
- Use manual `company_id` filtering in queries
- Apply application-level role checks

**LATER (After Phase 9): Security Hardening**
- Implement RLS policies on all 25 tables
- Configure Auth Hook to inject JWT claims (company_id, role, warehouse_id)
- Add database triggers for automatic tenant_id population
- Create security definer functions for elevated privilege operations
- Test RLS bypass scenarios and edge cases

### Next Steps
1. ‚úÖ ~~Validate existing schema against PRD requirements~~ (Completed Oct 13)
2. ‚úÖ ~~Document architectural decisions~~ (Completed Oct 13)
3. **Begin Phase 5: Products Management** (READY TO START)
4. Continue with Phases 6-9 (core feature development)
5. Security hardening phase after core features complete

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Migration Strategy Decision Point (Oct 11, 2025)

### Current Situation
- **Database**: Cloud production (Supabase MCP, not local)
- **Migrations**: 26 files with duplicates and column bloat
- **Status**: MVP stage with 3 test users
- **Issue**: Invites table has 21 columns (should be ~10)

### Best Practices Research (2025)
‚úÖ **Incremental migrations** strongly preferred for production
‚ùå **Big bang refactors** high risk, avoid unless necessary
‚úÖ **Use Supabase branching** for safe testing (beta feature)

### Recommended Approach: Clean Core Now
**Focus**: Companies, Users, Warehouses, Invites (foundation)
**Keep**: Products, Sales, Job Works, Goods Movement (build incrementally)
**Method**: Use Supabase branching to test safely

### Decision Pending
- Option A: Clean core migrations now (2-3 hours, solid foundation)
- Option B: Pure incremental (safer but builds on messy foundation)
- Option C: Wait until later (complexity compounds)

**See `.claude.md`** for detailed context and Supabase branching commands

## ‚úÖ Goods Receipt & Dispatch List Pages Fixed (Oct 16, 2025)

### What Was Fixed
Fixed critical database query errors and architectural issues in both goods receipts and goods dispatch list pages that were causing 404 errors and "column does not exist" errors.

### Issues Resolved

**Goods Dispatch Page:**
1. **Missing Foreign Key Hints** - PostgREST couldn't resolve ambiguous relationships
2. **Wrong Column Names** - Querying `partners.name` instead of `partners.company_name`
3. **TypeScript Interface Mismatch** - Client component expecting different field names

**Goods Receipts Page:**
1. **Wrong Architecture Pattern** - Client component using useEffect to call server actions (caused routing issues)
2. **Non-existent Columns** - Querying `code` and `partner_code` columns that don't exist
3. **Missing Relations** - Not including `goods_receipt_items` and `source_warehouses` relations

### Changes Made

**Goods Dispatch:**
- [x] Added explicit FK hints: `warehouses!goods_dispatches_warehouse_id_fkey`
- [x] Fixed partner relationship: `partners!goods_dispatches_dispatch_to_partner_id_fkey`
- [x] Fixed partner column: `name` ‚Üí `company_name`
- [x] Updated TypeScript interfaces in `GoodsDispatchClient.tsx`

**Goods Receipts:**
- [x] Converted `page.tsx` from client to server component (follows goods-dispatch pattern)
- [x] Removed useEffect data fetching (now uses server-side props)
- [x] Added explicit FK hints to all queries in `goods-receipts.ts`
- [x] Removed non-existent columns: `code`, `partner_code`
- [x] Added `goods_receipt_items` relation for quantity totals
- [x] Added `source_warehouses` relation for transfer receipts
- [x] Updated TypeScript interfaces in `GoodsReceiptsClient.tsx`
- [x] Simplified display functions

### Server-Client Architecture Applied
Both pages now follow the same pattern:
- **Server Component** (page.tsx): Auth, data fetching, pass props
- **Client Component** (Client.tsx): Filtering, interactions, state

### Files Modified
- `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/page.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/GoodsDispatchClient.tsx`
- `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-receipts/page.tsx` (complete rewrite)

### QR Scanner Implementation Details (Jan 17, 2025)

**Library Migration:**
- Replaced jsQR with html5-qrcode@2.3.8
- Reason: jsQR incompatible with Next.js, html5-qrcode has native mobile support
- Trust score: 10/10, production-tested by 1000+ projects

**QR Code Format:**
- Pattern: `QR-{uuid}-{unit_number}`
- Example: `QR-1ea3bca1-fc04-46ac-8d0e-0c246fa608e9-UNIT-000011`
- Parsing: Splits by hyphen, extracts unit number from parts[6+], UUID from parts[1-5]

**Matching Logic:**
```
Matches stock units by:
1. Extracted unit_number (from QR parsing)
2. Extracted UUID (from QR parsing)
3. Direct unit_number match (fallback)
4. Direct id match (fallback)
5. Product number match (alternative lookup)
```

**UX Enhancements:**
1. Instructions banner: "Scan multiple units ‚Ä¢ Camera stays active"
2. Live scan counter badge: "‚úì 3 units added"
3. Enhanced success toast: 3 seconds, larger size, checkmark icon
4. Comprehensive error messages with setup help
5. Manual input fallback for keyboard/barcode scanner entry

**Technical Fixes:**
1. jsQR build error ‚Üí Replaced with html5-qrcode
2. DOM manipulation error ‚Üí React state-based toast
3. QR format mismatch ‚Üí Added parsing logic
4. Duplicate key warning ‚Üí Functional state update
5. Status filter issue ‚Üí Documented correct behavior

**Testing Status:**
- ‚úÖ Camera integration working on desktop
- ‚úÖ QR code parsing extracts correct values
- ‚úÖ Stock unit matching working
- ‚úÖ Success toast displays correctly
- ‚úÖ Scan counter updates in real-time
- ‚úÖ Duplicate prevention working
- ‚úÖ Manual input functional
- ‚è≥ Mobile device testing (user to test on smartphone)

**Files Modified (Jan 17, 2025):**
1. `app/dashboard/inventory/goods-dispatch/components/QRScannerModal.tsx` (340+ lines)
   - Complete rewrite with html5-qrcode library
   - QR format parsing logic

## üìù Notes
- Focus on MVP features first (Phases 5-9)
- **Multi-Tenancy Strategy**: Use manual `company_id` filtering in queries for now; RLS policies will be implemented after core features (security hardening phase)
- **Role-Based Permissions**: Apply at application level (admin vs staff, warehouse access) until Auth Hook JWT claims are configured
- Test admin vs staff permissions for each feature
- Keep mobile-first approach in mind
- Document API endpoints as they're created
- Regular Git commits with meaningful messages

### Upgrade Flow Implementation Notes (Oct 12-13, 2025)
- **Design Principle**: Demo users authenticate via Supabase Auth but do NOT get a record in public.users table until admin approves their upgrade request
- **Database Separation**: `upgrade_requests` table stores pending requests separately from `users` table
- **Critical RLS Fix**: Added policy allowing users to query for their own `auth_user_id` even without DB record
- **Approval Creates Everything**: On approval, system creates company ‚Üí user record in single transaction
- **Column Name Issue**: Database uses `is_superadmin` (no underscore between "super" and "admin"), not `is_super_admin`
- **Email Service**: MSG91 configured but requires domain verification for sending emails
- **Testing Complete**: ‚úÖ Full approval flow tested successfully on Oct 12, 2025
  - Approved Chirag Bolar's request for "Chi fabrics" company
  - Company created with ID: a86a3118-0a77-4527-bb09-969e849b64e3
  - User record created with role=admin, is_demo=false, is_active=true
  - Warehouse creation will be added when inventory modules are built
- **Documentation**: Complete technical documentation available in `docs/UPGRADE_FLOW_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
