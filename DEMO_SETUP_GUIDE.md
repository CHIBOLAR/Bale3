## How to Setup Demo Account

### Step 1: Run the Seed Script

2. Creates demo user in Supabase Auth
3. Links user to company in database
4. Populates 2 warehouses
5. Creates 5 partners
6. Creates 10 products
7. Generates 5 goods receipts with stock units
8. Creates 8 sales orders with line items

**Expected Output:**

```

### Step 2: Verify Demo Login

1. Go to homepage: `http://localhost:3000`
2. Click "Try Demo" button
3. Should automatically log in and redirect to dashboard
4. Verify you see sample data in all modules

### Step 3: Test Demo Restrictions

**Test Create Limits:**

2. Try creating 6 products (should block at 5)
3. Verify error message shows upgrade CTA

**Test Delete Block:**
1. Try to delete any product
2. Should see: "Deleting items is disabled in demo mode"

**Test Update (Should Work):**
1. Edit any existing product

## Testing Checklist

## Architecture Notes

### No RLS (Application-Level Control)

We're NOT using Row Level Security policies. Instead:
- Demo checks happen in server actions
- Helper functions validate limits before database operations
- Cleaner error messages
- Easier to modify limits
- Can add RLS later if needed

### Demo vs Full Users

**Demo Users:**
- `is_demo: true` in users table
- Limited create permissions
- No delete permissions
- Redirected to upgrade CTAs

**Full Users:**
- `is_demo: false` in users table
- Unlimited permissions
- Full CRUD access
- Their own company data

## Maintenance

### Updating Demo Limits

Edit `lib/utils/demo-restrictions.ts`:
```typescript
export const DEMO_LIMITS = {
  MAX_PRODUCTS: 5,  // Change this
  MAX_PARTNERS: 3,  // Or this
  // etc...
}
```

### Resetting Demo Data

Run the seed script again:
```bash
npm run seed-demo
```

The script uses `upsert` so it won't duplicate data.

### Adding More Demo Actions

1. Import restrictions in action file:
```typescript
import { isDemoUser, checkDemoLimit, isDemoActionAllowed } from '@/lib/utils/demo-restrictions'
```

2. Check demo status:
```typescript
const { data: userData } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('company_id, id, is_demo')
  .eq('auth_user_id', user.id)
  .single()
```

3. Enforce limits:
```typescript
if (isDemoUser(userData)) {
  const limitCheck = await checkDemoLimit(
    supabase,
    userData.company_id,
    'table_name',
    'MAX_RESOURCE_NAME'
  );

  if (!limitCheck.allowed) {
    return { error: limitCheck.message };
  }
}
```
