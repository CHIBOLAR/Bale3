```

### Database Verification:

SELECT status, invite_id FROM invite_requests
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';

```

## Test 4: Execute Upgrade (Critical Test!)

### Steps:
1. **IMPORTANT: Stay logged in as demo user**
   - Do NOT log out
   - Do NOT close the browser
   - This tests the seamless upgrade flow

2. **In the SAME browser**, paste the upgrade link from Test 3**
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/upgrade?token=XXXXX
   ```

3. **Expected Result:**
   - âœ… Upgrade page loads
   - âœ… Shows: "Upgrade to Official Account"
   - âœ… Shows benefits list (4 checkmarks)
   - âœ… "Upgrade to Official Account" button visible
   - âœ… NO login prompt (already logged in)

4. **Click "Upgrade to Official Account" button**

5. **Expected Result:**
   - âœ… Success message: "Upgrade Complete!"
   - âœ… Shows new company name
   - âœ… "Redirecting to your dashboard..."
   - âœ… Auto-redirects to `/dashboard` after 2 seconds

6. **Verify Post-Upgrade Dashboard**
   - âœ… NO demo banner (banner disappeared)
   - âœ… Company name changed (no longer says "Demo Account")
   - âœ… Quick Actions changed to "Add New Product" (not "View Products")
   - âœ… Can access all features

### Database Verification (CRITICAL):
```sql
-- Check user was upgraded
SELECT
  id, email, first_name,
  role, is_demo, company_id
FROM users
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';

-- Expected AFTER upgrade:
-- role: 'admin' (changed from 'customer')
-- is_demo: false (changed from true)
-- company_id: [NEW company id, different from demo]

-- Check NEW company was created
SELECT * FROM companies
WHERE id = (
  SELECT company_id FROM users
  WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com'
);

-- Expected:
-- is_demo: false
-- name: "[YourName]'s Company"

-- Check warehouse was created
SELECT * FROM warehouses
WHERE company_id = (
  SELECT company_id FROM users
  WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com'
);

-- Expected:
-- name: 'Main Warehouse'

-- Check invite was marked accepted
SELECT status, accepted_at FROM invites
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com'
AND invite_type = 'platform'
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;

-- Expected:
-- status: 'accepted'
-- accepted_at: [timestamp]
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Email already exists" when requesting access
**Symptom:** Error when demo user tries to request official access
**Cause:** Old code that blocked existing users
**Fix:** Code updated in `app/api/request-invite/route.ts:31-49`
**Verify:** Should allow demo users to request

### Issue 2: Upgrade link gives "Invalid token"
**Symptom:** Upgrade page shows error
**Causes:**
- Token expired (7 days)
- Token already used
- Wrong email (invite for different email)
**Fix:** Admin creates new invite

### Issue 3: Upgrade button does nothing
**Symptom:** Click upgrade button, nothing happens
**Check:** Browser console for errors
**Verify:** User is logged in: `supabase.auth.getUser()`

### Issue 4: User gets logout prompt on upgrade page
**Symptom:** "You must be logged in to upgrade"
**Cause:** User logged out between request and upgrade
**Fix:** User logs back in, then clicks upgrade link again

### Issue 5: Demo banner still shows after upgrade
**Symptom:** Banner doesn't disappear
**Cause:** Page not refreshed after upgrade
**Fix:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5) or check `is_demo` in database
