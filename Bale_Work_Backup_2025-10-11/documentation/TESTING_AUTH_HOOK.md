# Testing Auth Hook Implementation

## üéØ What We're Testing

The auth hook should **prevent account creation** for users without valid invites.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FIRST: Enable the Auth Hook

**You MUST do this before testing!**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xejyeglxigdeznfitaxc/authentication/hooks
2. Find: **"Validate a user's sign-up"**
3. Click **Enable Hook**
4. Select: **`validate-signup`** from dropdown
5. Click **Save**

‚úÖ Verify it shows: `Status: Enabled`

---

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Test 1: User WITHOUT Invite (Should FAIL) ‚ùå

**Goal**: Verify auth hook blocks signup for uninvited emails

**Steps**:
1. Open incognito/private browser window
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/signup (or your production URL)
3. Click **"Sign in with Google"**
4. Select a Google account with email: `test-no-invite@gmail.com` (or any email NOT in invites table)

**Expected Result**:
- Google OAuth completes successfully
- But Supabase shows error message
- Error: "No platform invitation found for test-no-invite@gmail.com"
- You're redirected back to signup page
- **Account is NOT created in auth.users table** üéâ

**Verify**:
```sql
-- Check auth.users table in Supabase Dashboard
SELECT email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'test-no-invite@gmail.com';
-- Should return: 0 rows
```

---

### Test 2: User WITH Valid Invite (Should SUCCEED) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Verify auth hook allows signup for invited emails

**Steps**:

#### 2.1: Create a Platform Invite
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- Replace with YOUR actual user ID (from auth.users or users table)
SELECT create_platform_invite('invited-user@gmail.com', 'YOUR_USER_ID'::uuid);
```

This returns an invite code like: `7DBF2F52C315`

**Or create invite manually**:
```sql
INSERT INTO invites (
  email,
  invite_code,
  invite_type,
  status,
  expires_at,
  invited_by
) VALUES (
  'invited-user@gmail.com',
  'TEST12345678',
  'platform',
  'pending',
  NOW() + INTERVAL '48 hours',
  'YOUR_USER_ID'::uuid
);
```

#### 2.2: Verify Invite Exists
```sql
SELECT email, invite_code, status, expires_at
FROM invites
WHERE email = 'invited-user@gmail.com' AND status = 'pending';
```

Should return your invite.

#### 2.3: Try Signing Up
1. Open incognito/private browser window
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/signup
3. Click **"Sign in with Google"**
4. Select Google account: `invited-user@gmail.com`

**Expected Result**:
- Google OAuth completes
- Auth hook validates invite ‚Üí ALLOWS signup ‚úÖ
- Account created in auth.users
- Callback creates company, user, warehouse
- Redirected to: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- You see dashboard with company name

**Verify**:
```sql
-- 1. Check auth.users
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'invited-user@gmail.com';
-- Should return: 1 row

-- 2. Check invite was marked accepted
SELECT status, accepted_at FROM invites WHERE email = 'invited-user@gmail.com';
-- Should show: status = 'accepted', accepted_at = [timestamp]

-- 3. Check company was created
SELECT c.name, u.email, u.role
FROM companies c
JOIN users u ON u.company_id = c.id
WHERE u.email = 'invited-user@gmail.com';
-- Should show: company name, email, role = 'admin'

-- 4. Check warehouse was created
SELECT w.name, c.name as company_name
FROM warehouses w
JOIN companies c ON c.id = w.company_id
JOIN users u ON u.company_id = c.id
WHERE u.email = 'invited-user@gmail.com';
-- Should show: 'Main Warehouse'
```

---

### Test 3: Expired Invite (Should FAIL) ‚ùå

**Goal**: Verify auth hook rejects expired invites

**Steps**:

#### 3.1: Create Expired Invite
```sql
INSERT INTO invites (
  email,
  invite_code,
  invite_type,
  status,
  expires_at,  -- Already expired!
  invited_by
) VALUES (
  'expired-invite@gmail.com',
  'EXPIRED12345',
  'platform',
  'pending',
  NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour',  -- Expired 1 hour ago
  'YOUR_USER_ID'::uuid
);
```

#### 3.2: Try Signing Up
1. Open incognito window
2. Go to signup page
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Use email: `expired-invite@gmail.com`

**Expected Result**:
- Auth hook checks invite
- Finds invite but it's expired (expires_at < NOW())
- Rejects signup
- Error: "No platform invitation found..." (invite doesn't meet criteria)
- Account NOT created

---

### Test 4: Already Used Invite (Should FAIL) ‚ùå

**Goal**: Verify auth hook rejects used invites

**Steps**:

#### 4.1: Use Test 2's Invite Again
1. Sign out from dashboard
2. Try signing up again with `invited-user@gmail.com`

**Expected Result**:
- Auth hook finds invite but status = 'accepted'
- Rejects signup (only 'pending' invites are valid)
- Error message shown
- **BUT** since user already exists, they can just login normally

---

### Test 5: Returning User (Should SUCCEED) ‚úÖ

**Goal**: Verify existing users can login without issues

**Steps**:
1. Use account from Test 2 (`invited-user@gmail.com`)
2. Go to: http://localhost:3000/login
3. Click "Sign in with Google"
4. Select the account

**Expected Result**:
- Auth hook does NOT fire (only fires on NEW signups)
- User logs in successfully
- Redirected to dashboard
- All data intact

---

## üìä Monitoring During Tests

### View Auth Hook Logs

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xejyeglxigdeznfitaxc/functions/validate-signup/logs

2. You should see logs like:
```
Validating signup for: test-no-invite@gmail.com
No valid platform invite found for: test-no-invite@gmail.com
```

```
Validating signup for: invited-user@gmail.com
Valid invite found for: invited-user@gmail.com | Invite Code: TEST12345678
```

### View Application Logs

In your terminal running `npm run dev`, look for:
```
‚úÖ New user onboarding completed for: invited-user@gmail.com
```

Or errors:
```
UNEXPECTED: User passed auth hook but no invite found for: ...
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Test 1 passes (user WITHOUT invite CAN signup)

**Problem**: Hook is not enabled or not firing

**Solutions**:
1. Check hook is enabled in Dashboard
2. Verify function is deployed: `npx supabase functions list`
3. Check function logs for errors
4. Try redeploying: `npx supabase functions deploy validate-signup --project-ref xejyeglxigdeznfitaxc`

---

### Issue: Test 2 fails (user WITH invite CANNOT signup)

**Problem**: Invite validation logic might be too strict or invite not found

**Debug**:
1. Check function logs - what does it say?
2. Verify invite exists:
```sql
SELECT * FROM invites WHERE email = 'invited-user@gmail.com';
```
3. Check invite criteria:
   - `invite_type = 'platform'`
   - `status = 'pending'`
   - `expires_at > NOW()`

---

### Issue: "Server configuration error"

**Problem**: Edge Function missing environment variables

**Solution**:
- Environment variables should auto-populate
- Check in: Dashboard ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí validate-signup ‚Üí Settings
- Should have: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`

---

### Issue: Callback shows "UNEXPECTED: User passed auth hook but no invite found"

**Problem**: Race condition or invite was deleted/modified between hook and callback

**Debug**:
1. Check invite still exists and is pending
2. Check function logs to see what hook saw
3. Verify system time is correct

---

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

After running all tests, you should have:

- ‚úÖ Test 1: Uninvited user blocked (no account created)
- ‚úÖ Test 2: Invited user succeeds (account + company + warehouse created)
- ‚úÖ Test 3: Expired invite blocked
- ‚úÖ Test 4: Used invite blocked (but user can login)
- ‚úÖ Test 5: Existing user can login

**Most Important**: Check `auth.users` table has NO orphaned accounts from failed signups!

---

## üéâ What You've Achieved

**Before**: Users without invites could create accounts in auth.users, then get blocked in callback ‚Üí orphaned accounts

**After**: Auth hook validates BEFORE account creation ‚Üí clean database, no orphans! üéâ

---

## üìù Next Steps After Testing

Once all tests pass:

1. ‚úÖ Update documentation with new auth flow
2. ‚úÖ Create admin panel for invite management (future)
3. ‚úÖ Set up email notifications for invites (future)
4. ‚úÖ Monitor auth hook performance in production
