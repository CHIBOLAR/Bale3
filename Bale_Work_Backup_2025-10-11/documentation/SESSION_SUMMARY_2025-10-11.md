# Session Summary - Auth System Improvements
**Date:** October 11, 2025
**Branch:** `feat/auth-improvements`
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Pushed to GitHub

---

## 🎯 Overview

This session focused on completing the admin invite system and fixing critical issues in the OTP-based signup flow. The goal was to enable a complete end-to-end flow where:

1. Users submit access requests
2. Admins approve requests
3. Users receive invite links
4. Users verify OTP and get full access

All objectives were successfully achieved and tested.

---

## 🔧 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. RLS Policy Error - Public Access Requests Blocked
**Problem:**
```
Error: new row violates row-level security policy for table "invites"
```
- Anonymous users couldn't submit access requests via `/api/request-invite`
- The `invites` table had no INSERT policy for anonymous users

**Solution:**
- Added RLS policy to allow anonymous INSERT for access requests
- Policy checks: `invite_type='platform'`, `status='pending'`, `request_type='access_request'`

**Migration:** `20250111_fix_invites_rls.sql`

---

### 2. NOT NULL Constraint Error on `invited_by`
**Problem:**
```
Error: null value in column "invited_by" violates not-null constraint
```
- Column `invited_by` was required but should only be set when admin approves
- New access requests have no `invited_by` value

**Solution:**
- Made `invited_by` column nullable
- Set only when admin approves the request

**Migration:** `20250111_make_invited_by_nullable.sql`

---

### 3. Signup Page - Invalid Invite Code Error
**Problem:**
- Users clicking approved invite links saw "Invalid invite code"
- Anonymous users couldn't SELECT invites to validate the code

**Solution:**
- Added RLS policy for anonymous SELECT on accepted invites
- Policy: `invite_type='platform'` AND `status='accepted'`

**Migration:** `20250111_fix_invites_rls.sql`

---

### 4. Signup Page - Cannot Create Company/User Records
**Problem:**
- After OTP verification, signup failed silently
- RLS blocked authenticated users from creating company/user records

**Solution:**
- Added RLS policy for authenticated users to INSERT companies
- Added RLS policy for users to INSERT their own user record (matching auth_user_id)
- Added RLS policy for users to UPDATE their own user record

**Migration:** `20250111_allow_signup_create_records.sql`

---

### 5. OTP Verification Page Stuck on Rate Limit
**Problem:**
- After clicking "Send Verification Code", page showed:
  > "For security purposes, you can only request this after 57 seconds"
- OTP was sent but page didn't show input field
- Root cause: Code called `signInWithOtp` **twice**, triggering 60s rate limit

**Solution:**
- Removed duplicate OTP call
- Added graceful rate limit handling
- Transition to OTP input even if rate limited (OTP already sent)

**File:** `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`

---

## 🗄️ Database Migrations Applied

### Migration 1: Fix Invites RLS Policies
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250111_fix_invites_rls.sql`

**Policies Added:**
1. **Allow public insert for access requests** (anon)
   - Enables `/api/request-invite` to work
2. **Allow service role full access** (service_role)
   - Admin APIs can manage invites
3. **Users can view their own invites** (authenticated)
   - Users can check their invite status
4. **Admins can view all invites** (authenticated admins)
   - Powers admin dashboard
5. **Admins can update invites** (authenticated admins)
   - Approve/reject functionality
6. **Allow anon to view invite by code** (anon)
   - Signup page validation

---

### Migration 2: Make invited_by Nullable
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250111_make_invited_by_nullable.sql`

```sql
ALTER TABLE invites
ALTER COLUMN invited_by DROP NOT NULL;
```

**Reasoning:** Only set when admin approves, not during request creation

---

### Migration 3: Allow Signup Record Creation
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20250111_allow_signup_create_records.sql`

**Policies Added:**
1. **Allow authenticated users to create company**
   - New users can create their company during signup
2. **Users can create their own record**
   - Users can insert into `users` where `auth_user_id = auth.uid()`
3. **Users can update their own record**
   - Users can modify their profile

---

## 💾 Code Changes

### 1. Signup Page - OTP Flow Fix
**File:** `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
const handleSendOTP = async () => {
  // Check if user exists (First OTP call)
  await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email, options: { shouldCreateUser: false } });

  // Send OTP (Second OTP call - triggers rate limit!)
  await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({ email, options: { shouldCreateUser: true } });

  setStep('verify-otp');
};
```

**After:**
```typescript
const handleSendOTP = async () => {
  // Send OTP once
  const { error: otpError } = await supabase.auth.signInWithOtp({
    email,
    options: { shouldCreateUser: true, data: { invite_code: inviteCode } }
  });

  // Handle rate limit gracefully
  if (otpError?.message?.includes('security') || otpError?.message?.includes('seconds')) {
    console.log('Rate limit hit, but OTP likely already sent');
    setStep('verify-otp');
    return;
  }

  if (otpError) throw otpError;
  setStep('verify-otp');
};
```

**Changes:**
- ✅ Removed duplicate OTP call
- ✅ Added rate limit detection
- ✅ Gracefully transition to OTP input even if rate limited

## 🎓 Key Learnings

### 1. Supabase Rate Limiting
- OTP requests limited to 1 per 60 seconds per email
- Multiple calls trigger "For security purposes..." error
- Always send OTP once and handle errors gracefully

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS)
- Client-side code uses user's auth token (not service role)
- Must explicitly allow operations (INSERT/SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Anonymous users need separate policies from authenticated
- Service role bypasses RLS (use in server-side APIs)

### 3. Next.js Server vs Client Components
- Server Components can't pass event handlers
- Client Components need `'use client'` directive
- Supabase client-side operations respect RLS
- Use server components for initial data fetching

### 4. Invite System Design
- Store invites with metadata in JSONB for flexibility
- Status: pending → accepted → expired (used)
- `invited_by` nullable (set on approval)
- Unique codes for tracking and validation
