# Bale Inventory & Accounting System - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 3.0 (Revised - Practical Implementation Plan)
**Date:** October 2025
**Status:** Inventory Complete ‚úÖ | Accounting In Progress ‚è≥
**Target Market:** Textile/Fabric Trading Businesses in India

---

## Executive Summary

### Current Status

**Phase 1 Complete:** Advanced inventory module with QR tracking ‚úÖ
**Phase 2 Starting:** Adding Tally-compatible accounting module ‚è≥

### The Strategy

**Build on Existing Inventory + Add Accounting**

This system combines:
1. **Existing Advanced Inventory** (COMPLETE) - QR-coded roll tracking, quality grading, job work, sales orders
2. **New Accounting Module** (TO BUILD) - Tally-compatible Groups, Ledgers, Vouchers integrated with existing inventory
3. **Tally Export Capability** (FUTURE) - CAs can verify data in Tally Prime anytime

### Critical Requirement

**Client Decision:** "Either your app does BOTH accounting AND inventory, OR we stick with Tally only"
- No "inventory-only" app acceptable
- No two-app solution (Tally + separate inventory)
- Must be complete Tally replacement

### Core Differentiators

1. ‚úÖ **Individual Roll Tracking** - QR codes for every fabric roll (BUILT)
2. ‚úÖ **Fabric-Specific Attributes** - GSM, thread count, color, variants (BUILT)
3. ‚úÖ **Mobile Warehouse App** - Receipt/dispatch with QR scanning (BUILT)
4. ‚úÖ **Quality Grading** - A/B/C grade tracking and pricing (BUILT)
5. ‚úÖ **Job Work Management** - Dyeing, printing with progress tracking (BUILT)
6. ‚úÖ **Sales Order Workflow** - End-to-end order fulfillment (BUILT)
7. ‚è≥ **Tally-Compatible Accounting** - Groups, ledgers, vouchers (TO BUILD)
8. ‚è≥ **GST Compliance** - GSTR-1/2B/3B, E-invoice, E-way bill (TO BUILD)
9. ‚è≥ **Tally XML Export** - Full data export for CA verification (TO BUILD)

### Database Overview

**Existing Tables (Inventory Module - BUILT):**

- ‚è≥ Views: ledger_balances

**Design Principles:**
- üîó **Integrated, Not Separate** - Accounting links to existing partners, products, warehouses
- üì± **Application Logic, Not Triggers** - Business logic in TypeScript, not database triggers
- üöÄ **Performance First** - Materialized views for balance caching
- üîê **Security** - Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Double-entry bugs | Application-layer validation + comprehensive tests, NOT database triggers |
| Breaking existing inventory | Accounting module is additive only - no changes to existing tables |
| Performance (large datasets) | Materialized views for balances, proper indexing, cursor pagination |
| Tally export incompatibility | Start with simple export, test with real Tally Prime, iterate |

### Business Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| CA rejection | Build trial balance first, get early feedback, provide Tally export |
| Complex accounting | Focus on 80% use case (Payment, Receipt, Sales, Purchase only initially) |
| GST rule changes | Modular GST layer in application code, easy to update |
| Integration bugs | Thorough testing of goods_receipt ‚Üí voucher and goods_dispatch ‚Üí voucher flows |

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|
| Scope creep | Stick to phased approach, Phase 2 must ship in 6 weeks max |
| Over-engineering | Use application logic, avoid complex triggers, JSONB for flexibility |
| Poor integration | Link ledgers to partners, vouchers to existing receipts/dispatches from day 1 |
