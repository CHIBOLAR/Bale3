# Our Brand Philosophy

We believe in transforming traditional fabric businesses through accessible technology.

We are building software specifically for fabric traders - not too simple like generic software, not too complex like enterprise ERP, but just right for fabric businesses.

We value saving business owners' time because **that hour matters for quality of life**.

We are **accessible, energetic and honest**. We wish to be partners in digital transformation - never talking down, always collaborating like friends.

# Brandmark & Logo Usage

---

## Master Logo

Our master logo primarily consists of:
- The symbol: Two stacked fabric rolls with concentric circles
- The wordmark: "Bale"
- The tagline (optional): "Bale lagao visibility pao"

The symbol and wordmark should always be used as a whole unit.

This is the only logo that should be used to represent the brand.

The colour variations must be reproduced according to the brand guidelines.

---

## Logo Usage

When placing it on a white background, we will always use the full-colour logo (orange or blue variations).

While placing it on any other background colour, we will pick from the single-colour options.

We will use the black and white logo option only when we are printing collaterals in black and white.

---

## Logo Variations

The logo is available to use in the following colour schemes.

**Full Colour - Orange:**
- Use on white or cream backgrounds
- Primary energetic identity

**Full Colour - Blue:**
- Use on white or cream backgrounds
- Professional identity

**Monochrome - White:**
- Use on blue or dark backgrounds

**Monochrome - Black:**
- Use on light backgrounds for print

## Our Brand
### Protecting the Logo

With our logo, we aim to be instantly recognisable everywhere we use it.

Big or small, our logo should always lead to maximum impact and recall, by:

- Choosing the right colour scheme as the touchpoint
- Adhering to the clear space guidelines to ensure optimum legibility

### Clear Space

We protect the logo with clear space.

**Clear space = 50% of the height of one fabric roll (the "o" shape)**

In exceptional circumstances graphic elements may infringe into the clear space.

---

## Minimum Size

The Bale logo should always be prominent and clear, across all touchpoints.

To ensure that our logo is always legible, the smallest size recommended is **40mm width**.

---

# Typography

---

Being a service designed for fabric traders who evaluate designs professionally every day, typography plays a crucial role in our brand story.

Our chosen font aids clarity and legibility, even in the smallest size. By picking a web font, we ensure that it's seamless across digital and offline touchpoints.

Additionally, the font family has a huge range of weights, from light to black. The hierarchy will allow us to present information in the most comprehensible manner.

The font also supports all the relevant symbols (from ₹ to #), which are crucial to our business, as well as a clear and bold slate of numerics.

# Iconography

---

## Iconography

Building on our fabric roll symbolism and rounded design, our library of icons must follow the same look and feel.

We will always use a 2-colour palette for our iconography, which further aids brand recall.

Additionally, we will add depth to the icons and ensure it pops out on digital channels, with the use of shadow.

### Style Principles:
- Rounded, friendly shapes (consistent with fabric roll circles)
- 2-colour: Blue + Orange accents
- Bold outlines for clarity
- Modern, minimal, industry-specific
